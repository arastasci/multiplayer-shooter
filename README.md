# multiplayer shooter

This is the source code of the multiplayer shooter game I made. The repository consists of two projects; one for the client and one for the server.

## Gameplay

The gameloop is as simple as it gets, it's an endless deathmatch. You have two weapons, a pistol and a rocket launcher. You can propel yourself with the rockets you launch and shoot enemies with both guns. The movement is fast paced with wall jumps, bunny-hops and rocket jumping, making evading bullets easier and shooting players harder.

## Setup

In order to play, you need to required set a server up. You can either forward a port for your router or use a server provider like AWS and set up a dedicated server.
